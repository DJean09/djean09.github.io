                <h1>Title: Wireless Receival of ROV Data & Simulation of Wireless Control of Underwater Drones using Acoustics</h1>
                <p><span>Introduction:</span> Remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) are a useful and popular platform for underwater 
                    exploration in ocean environments. They are typically equipped with cameras, thrusters, and lights for better viewing 
                    underwater. Many smaller ROVs use tethers for communication between the ground control and the submerged ROV. This, 
                    however, presents a physical limitation as the ROV can only move as far as the tether will allow it to. Attempts have 
                    been made to work around this limitation through the usage of wireless communication methods for the command and control 
                    of ROVs. In the paper “Towards Wireless Controlled Underwater Vehicles” the authors describe an implementation of a BlueROV2 
                    using a LoRa-based radio for communications. Radio communication underwater is not ideal underwater due to the rapid attenuation 
                    of RF radio signals in the water so this implementation while proving the concept of wireless underwater drones possible, 
                    still has significant range limitations as the tether approach does.</p>
                
                <p><span>My Role:</span> As a key member of the project team, my focus was twofold: developing a realistic simulation of the BlueROV 
                    using Unreal Engine and contributing to the coding efforts for the drone's communication protocols. The simulation, crafted entirely 
                    by me, served as a critical testing ground for our theories and designs.</p>

                <p><span>Simulation Development:</span> Using HoloOcean as a foundation, I meticulously modeled the BlueROV, ensuring the virtual counterpart 
                    mirrored the real drone's specifications. The immersive environment I created was not just a visual spectacle but a functional space 
                    where the intricate dance of data transmission unfolded. The simulation displayed key metrics such as transmission time, depth, location, 
                    and signal characteristics, painting a vivid picture of the underwater communication process.</p>
